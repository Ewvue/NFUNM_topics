### *Call for Workshop Proposals*
### Propose a Workshop
Are you working in an emerging area in MobileHCI? Consider organizing a workshop! Organising a workshop is a great opportunity to move the field forward and to build a community around emerging topics.
### Important Dates
- Proposal submission deadline (for organisers): March 1st, 2019 (17:00 PST)
- Proposal notification (for organisers): March 15th
### General Information
Workshops allow members of a community to meet in the context of a focused and interactive discussion, and to move the field forward and to build a community. MobileHCI workshops might address basic research, applied research, HCI practice, new methodologies, emerging application areas, design innovations, management and organizational issues, or HCI education. Each workshop should generate ideas that give the MobileHCI community a new, organized way of thinking about the topic, or ideas that suggest promising directions for future research. Some workshops result in edited books or special issues of journals; you may consider including such a goal in the design of your workshop. Please note that for workshop proposals of comparable quality, preference will be given to workshops containing discussion and interactive sessions.

Workshops will be held on October 1st. They should offer a mid-morning break, a lunch break, and a mid-afternoon break. Workshops typically have 15 to 20 participants. Focused interaction among participants is important. Participants must have informed positions based on prior experience.
### Submissions
Please submit your workshop proposal via [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/account/signin.cgi?key=82932277.p2dPybiKb9KfJ4Xs). A workshop proposal submission consists of a single PDF file in the [SIGCHI Extended Abstracts Format](https://sigchi.github.io/Document-Formats/). Submissions should be four pages or less excluding references, detailing your goals for the workshop, how you plan to run the workshop, any planned outcomes, and a short bio of the organizers. For your convenience, we prepared a [template](https://mobilehci.acm.org/2018/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/MobileHCI2018-Workshop-Template.docx).

*March 1st, 2019* (17:00 PST) is the submission deadline for workshop proposals.
Proposals will be juried. Accepted workshops will be publicized on the MobileHCI website.
### Responsibility of Workshop Organizers
- Please keep the following responsibilities in mind when submitting a workshop proposal:
Publicize their workshop: organizers of an accepted workshop are encouraged to set up and maintain locally a web page in which they provide further and updated information about their workshop. The local page of the workshop will be reachable from the official MobileHCI workshop site.
- Solicit papers from potential participants: A workshop paper is generally 2-4 pages long and outlines the submitter’s view on the workshop theme and the reasons for the submitter’s interest in the topic.
- Select participants on the basis of papers submitted to them. We expect workshops to target a minimum number of 10 participants.
- Distribute papers and other pre-workshop materials to participants in advance of the workshop.
- Develop a final agenda of workshop activities.
At the workshop, the organizer is responsible for facilitating discussion, maintaining productive interaction, and encouraging participation. The emphasis should be on group discussion, rather than on presentation of individual papers. Diversity of perspectives should be encouraged.

We will provide the following A/V equipment: projector, screen, 1 flipchart, and pens. Regarding wireless availability, network connectivity is available in the facility.
